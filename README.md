IntelliChat is an advanced Language Model-based chat system that leverages the power of ChatGPT-4 to engage in natural, flowing conversations with users. Unlike traditional chatbots, IntelliChat is designed to remember past interactions by storing them in a database, allowing users to pick up conversations right where they left off. A standout feature of IntelliChat is its capability to access the internet through an API endpoint, giving it the ability to "Google" information, thus significantly broadening its conversational scope beyond that of ChatGPT.
